I renamed the music folder to "audio" and added more music to the html| editted 36 characters in Dave The Magical Cheese Wizard
to work with the images folder| and I fixed the green and purple movement so they don't go ballistic and in my opinion it looks
nicer, also made the path for orange slightly more varied, purple now teleports around as if it were venting

12/31/2025
I've finally fixed all the issues git had with my commits(wow I really haven't done much in a while) | oh and some other things
that I no longer remember that I did before I had the commit issue

renamed the music folder to audio and replaced some of the songs with looped versions | put the projects I made for my friends
in 1 folder | updated the Html reference folder to work with the new images/ audio folders | deleted the video folder and
renamed the pictures folder to images | updated Dave The Magical Cheese Wizard to work with the new images / audio folder | 
updated the platformers to work with the new folders along with the level generation to match the "R" key in the 1st platformer
 | functionally the Rainbow Friends game is finished although I do plan to try and make it look good

12/24/2025
added new song to the Music folder | made a copy of the platformer for a friend of mine | made some text changes to the

I have for the most part completed my reference guide to HTML and have updated the tab name for the ball game and made it more
storage friendly Note: haven't updated everything yet but I might tomorrow. If I remember to commit instead of waiting 5 years
-I also might have editted the wording of the last commit but it's the same
